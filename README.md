A blockchain system built using Python for backend and JS & React for frontend as a part of a course by David Katz (15Dkatz  https://github.com/15Dkatz ).

**The course is designed to help you achieve three main goals:**
- Learn Python and Backend Web Development.
- Build a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Project that you can add to your portfolio.
- Learn JavaScript, Frontend Web Development, React.js, and React Hooks.

The course's main project is to build a blockchain and cryptocurrency. With a blockchain and cryptocurrency system as the main goal, you will go through a course journey that starts with backend development using Python. Then, you will transaction to frontend web development with JavaScript, React.js, and React Hooks.
